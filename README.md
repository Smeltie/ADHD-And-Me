# ADHD-And-Me

Heya I'm Smeltie!
And I have ADHD, not the hyper active kind...

For me it outs itself as:
- Hyperfixation
- Difficulty focussing for long periods of time
- Being a bit of a forgetful klutz sometimes

However I see my ADHD as a blessing instead of a curse.
My adhd allows me to:
- Learn really fast when hyperfixation kicks in
- Be a great speaker and be able to capture and hold an audience's attention.
- Be able to think outside of the box and come up with creative and unique solutions to problems.
